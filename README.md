# py-ae-dj

Welcome!

## Goals

py-ae-dj is an experimental project helping developers use Python on Google
App Engine. It has minimal, but all nessesary tools for setting up,
developing, testing, configuring, deploying, managining, and supporting a
typical Python App Engine application.

We have two versions:
* **CURRENT** -- Python 3.7 API server with JavaScript responsive web app [(link)](./toybox/README.md)
* **DEPRECATED** -- Python 2.7 server with Django and server-side template rendering [(link)](./platform/README.md)

Good luck!
